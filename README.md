# project_scrum

... adds scrum functionality (like User Stories, sprints, scrum roles, etc) to the default Odoo project management module (which it also depends on naturally).

In order to run "project_scrum" you need to have the pyhton library "Beautiful Soup" (python-bs4) installed on your system.
You can do that by the following command: sudo apt-get install python-bs4
